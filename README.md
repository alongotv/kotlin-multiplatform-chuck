# kotlin-multiplatform-chuck
Good-ol' Chuck Norris jokes. Now in Kotlin Multiplatform app.

Uses Ktor for HTTP requests, Kodein-DI for dependency injection on the multiplatform level.

The goal of this project is to create an application example I wished I had during my first introduction to Kotlin Multiplatform.

API provided by api.chucknorris.io

By the way, Chuck Norris does not need to use expect/actual mechanism. His common code runs on all platforms!
